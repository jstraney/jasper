NOTES fOR JASPER

Entity
  * Improve component and widget class
      - give widgets some kind of 'repack' method.
      - widgets should have layer entities that fit into rows.
      - once it's improved, make text label extend 'component'
  * add various shape classes that extend shape (really just a 'circ' class)
      - shapes should share an interface of calcArea, getCenter, contains, isColliding
      - shapes class is doing some weird recursive thing...
  * create a way to read entities from json.
  
Util
  * pathfinder
  
Init
  
  
Event
  
  
Asset
  * integrate howler. use it to build audio asset
  * create an assetLoader?
    - would check if assets are loaded and then fire a callback like 'changeGameState' or w/e
  
State

Controller
  * rename events to be "UP_IS_DOWN" instead of "UP_DOWN", etc. This is confusing
  
  
Graphics
  * extra fancy webGL things

Physics
