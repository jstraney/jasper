NOTES fOR JASPER

Entity
  * Improve component and widget class
      - give component some kind of 'repack' method.
      - components should have layer entities that fit into rows.
      - once it's improved, make text label extend 'component'
  * add various shape classes that extend shape (really just a 'circ' class)
      - shapes should share an interface of calcArea, getCenter, contains, isColliding
      - shapes class is doing some weird recursive thing...
  * create a way to read entities from json.
  
Util
