NOTES fOR JASPER

Entity
  * Improve component and widget class
      - give widgets some kind of 'repack' method.
      - widgets should have layer entities that fit into rows.
      - once it's improved, make text label extend 'component'
      - should I just use abs positioned doms?
  * add various shape classes that extend shape (really just improve 'circ' class)
      - shapes should share an interface of calcArea, getCenter, contains, isColliding
  * create a way to read entities from json.
  * should I encapsulate entity x, y, w, h?
  
Util
  * pathfinder
  * Camera (how is this done best? is util appropriate, or graphics?)
  
Init
  
  
Event
  
  
Asset
  * allow getMapData to parse compressed tmx files. Right now can only read plain text
  
  * create an assetLoader?
    - would check if assets are loaded and then fire a callback like 'changeGameState' or w/e
  
State

Controller
  * rename events to be "UP_IS_DOWN" instead of "UP_DOWN", etc. This is confusing
  
  
Graphics
  * extra fancy webGL things if possible

Physics
  * work on pinball and platformer physics
