NOTES fOR JASPER ARCADE
currently...
  add a spawnPoint class

  create a json schema for entities. can integrate into tiled?
  figure out audio. Could use Howler js

the basic functionality for entitites should include:
  private animation classes. <-- needs testing + features
  gui entities. <-- haven't started
  

on the table...
  physics?
    have a physics component that wraps entities
    and changes the x and y based on vector math
    with other colliders
  Pretty much got it =(
